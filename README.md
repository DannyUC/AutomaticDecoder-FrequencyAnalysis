# Automatic decoder of DTMF tones ðŸŽ¶

## Description
Automatic decoder of DTMF tones with frequency analysis, using **MATLAB** and **Signal Processing** concepts.

## Objective
Given a DTMF (dual tone multiple frequency) tone sequence generated by a telephone keypad, create a procedure that decodes a telephone number. Each number is generated by the combination of 2 sinusoidal signals with the duration of 50 ms. It uses a DFT with 512 points.
